# ML_introduction
This is an initial approach to basic Machine Learning concepts, such as: reading, visualizing and preprocessing of data, as well as some supervised algorithm such as kNN and Decision Trees. Other concepts like model evaluation and model tunning are also considered in these notebooks. 

These notebooks are based on the academic material provided to all students of the SITC class of the MUIRST program from UPM, program to which I graduated from.
