# ML_introduction
This is an initial approach to Machine Learning concepts solving some basic classification problems, using different supervised learning algorithms such as k nearest neighbors (kNN), decision tress, etc. 

Among the concepts studied in this notebook are: data reading and visualizing, feature engineering, preprocessing of data, training and test split, model trainning, model evaluation and hyperparameters tunnig. Different tools had been used in this notebook such as the likes of scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, seaborn, among others.

These notebooks are based on the academic material provided to all students of the SITC class of the MUIRST program from UPM, program to which I graduated from.
